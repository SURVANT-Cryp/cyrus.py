“Terrorism is statistically related to the
acceptance of the rights of others, good relations
with neighbours, likelihood of violent
demonstrations and political terror.”

“By days when the wind bangs alley gates ajar
and the sun goes by on the wind. By nights when
the moon is an only child above the measured
thunder of the cars, you may know Chicago’s
heart at last.”

“When they’re undetectable and they can walk
out of that ballroom into the sunlight and onto
the subway and get home, and still have all their
clothes and no blood running off their
bodies—those are the femme realness queens.”

“Culture was reconceived as an assemblage of
disparate and incommensurate things throwing
themselves together in scenes, acts, encounters,
performances, and situations. Writing became an
attunement, a response, a vigilant protection of a
worlding. Both writing and culture became
potentially generative and capacious. A writing
might skid over the surface of something throwing
itself together or it might pause on a strand as
it moved with other strands or fell out of sync,
becoming an anomaly or a problem. Writing could be
a way of thinking.”

“I consider that the Golden Rule requires that
if I like a program I must share it with other
people who like it.”

“I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of
alleys, such enigmatical entries, and such
sphinx’s riddles of streets without
thoroughfares”

“All over this desert metropolis, in shelters
and churches that care for migrants, Ramos
provides a service that no Mexican or American
government agency or NGO will.”

The traffic rules have not yet taken effect, and
the right wind blows from the left. But the horse
is also a war machine, the road a cloud, the
asphalt slackens, time picks up. The turf is ours
by right because it’s our turn.

“LinkNYC strives to maintain a safe environment
while still balancing free and open internet
access. Link tablets use a DNS content filtering
system that blocks domains known to contain adult
or inappropriate content – the same system used
by thousands of public schools and libraries
across the country.”

“hooks also questions the political efficacy of
the drag balls themselves, citing her own
experimentations with drag, and suggesting that
the balls themselves lack political, artistic, and
social significance.”

“As an urban transplant, I sometimes feel a long
way from home and a long way from my ancestors.”

“Pro-auto groups promoted [the] use of the word
‘jay walker’ as someone who didn’t know how
to walk in a city, threatening public safety.”

“Each of the communities examined in this
thesis, as mediated through the eyes of the
flaneur, are depicted as besieged by white
mainstream culture. Otherness is forced outward
into marginal spaces by the dominant classes, only
for those spaces to be gradually infiltrated by
the dominant classes themselves. The original
inhabitants of marginal spaces are united in their
persistent refusal to conform. The flaneur
demonstrates how perpetual pressure from the
centre potentiates communal bonds.”

“The pattern that arises here—that of making
unusual connections, violence against habitual
thought as a means of achieving a new or
collective language or code, and the establishment
or reconﬁguration of worlds—is an aesthetic of
cruelty shared by both writers.”

“De Quincey describes using the stars to guide
him home. Having no knowledge of celestial
navigation he finds himself in unfamiliar
territories, discovering what he believes are
streets anonymous to maps, thus reimagining the
city in his own eyes.”

“For both Siratori and Artaud, the program is
one of the radical rejection of the conventions of
the media and social context within which their
work is situated: for Artaud, the blunt rejection
of ‘an entirely theatrical tradition’ while
for Siratori it is the relentless assault upon the
conventions of syntax, plot, national language,
and sense of the novel.”

“Jacobs would take random subway rides to an
unfamiliar part of the city. On one of those
expeditions, Jacobs got off at the Christopher
Street stop, climbed the stairs to the sidewalk,
and quickly became ‘enchanted.’”

“Information attacks — like the one depicted
above — can be summed up in one centuries-old
word: Provokatsiya, which is Russian for ‘act of
provocation.’”

“To the south, cinder-block-and-plywood
shantytowns covered Tijuana’s dun-colored desert
hills and canyons.”

You might sneer at this, but I know now. But they
can read glances through the back of their heads.
Now there ain’t but 20,000 police in the whole
town.

“Convoys of camouflaged soldiers with AK-47s can
be seen driving to and from Caracol Morelia. On
the winding roads through the mountains, army
bases dot the landscape as reminders of the
area’s contentious history.”
