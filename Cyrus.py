#   The commonsense acceptance of the city at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. CYRUS.py is an experimental intertextual poetics + research tool exploring notions of counterpublic identity, enclosure, hacker practice and terrorism in metropolises/netropolises. CYRUS.py combines cherry-picked output from a cut-up generator (also written in Python) with extracts from various web sources exploring the aforementioned topics. The cut-up generator outputs cut-up texts drawn from five writings, all dealing with transgressive groups—Fight Club, Invisible Man, Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos, Hackers (by Aase Berg), and The Warriors original movie script. I have changed some names and places of the original writings to help develop a more unified narrative. The form of CYRUS.py owes a great deal to the practices and methodologies of the Dadaists, William S. Burroughs, John Cage, and other aleatory operation practitioners, but also, the practice of flânerie in all its incarnations.
