#   The commonsense acceptance of place at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. cyrus.py is an experimental intertextual poetics + research tool that explores counterpublic identity, hacking, algorithms, terrorism, and the relationship between walking, language, and place. cyrus.py combines extracts from an eclectic array of sources exploring the above-mentioned topics with cherry-picked output from another cut-up generator I created; this earlier program (also written in Python) outputted cut-ups of five books/writings: Fight Club, Invisible Man, Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos, Hackers (by Aase Berg), and The Warriors original movie script.

The average territory for a coyote family group covers two square miles, with a large degree of variance depending on available food sources.”', '“Haraway is right: our lives are entangled with coyote discourse, and increasingly in the city with the discourse of actual coyotes, who remind us that wildness moves amid urban areas that we often think of as solely, or mostly, our domain.”', '“A chain-link fence runs most of the length of the Channel canal, keeping people from the water, so if you’re not willing to clamber up and over, you can get to the canal only at special access points.”', '“As an urban transplant, I sometimes feel a long way from home and a long way from my ancestors.”', '“Laid to rust upon the green since devlinsfirst loved livvy.”', '“Through procedure, constraint, reappropriation, and other forms of mediation taken up by contemporary poets, the poem is revealed to be a site of discourse and a site of counter-hegemonic strategy rather than the expression of a unique individual—the subject perceived as autonomous and individuated.”', '“Not having to find parking or pay for anger management classes compensates for the small inconveniences of not owning a car. Another ancillary benefit is the gift of exploring the city by foot, at a pace conducive to free­-ranging thoughts.”', '“When we later detrain, the streets will be a chaos of bodies jostling without ever quite touching. But for now, we all mill about on the platform, closer to sleep than to work.”', '“By the time he swivels his neck, following my transfixed gaze, the city’s trickster, the wild canine ghost of Chicagoland, has melted away.”', '“Bezdomny attempts to chase Woland and his gang but ends up in a lunatic asylum, ranting about an evil professor who is obsessed with Pontius Pilate.”', '“In dealing so frivolously and surreally with the nightmare society in which Woland wreaks havoc, Bulgakov’s satire becomes vicious without even needing to draw blood.”', '“In 2010, Matt Green decided to walk every block of every street in New York City’s five boroughs, living on a $15/day budget the entire time. He originally believed the journey would take around 2.5 years, but in the end it took him closer to six years.”', '“Rather than trying to rigorously determine the most efficient route to accomplish my goal, I’m going to keep a more flexible approach. Each day I will simply walk somewhere I haven’t been yet, hopefully jumping from neighborhood to neighborhood for the sake of variety. As my progress map begins to fill in, my options for where to walk next will become narrower and narrower until, finally, there will be no streets left unwalked. At that point I will probably drink a beer and sit down for a while.”', '“A town of many angry sayings, some loud and some soft; some out of the corner of the mouth and some straight off the shoulder.”', '“For it isn’t so much a city as it is a drafty hustler’s junction in which to hustle awhile and move on out of the draft.', '“Yet on nights when, under all the arc-lamps, the little men of the rain come running, you’ll know at last that, long long ago, something went wrong between St. Columbanus and North Troy Street.”', '“The nameless, useless nobodies who sleep behind the taverns, who sleep beneath the El. Who sleep in burnt-out busses with the windows freshly curtained; in winterized chicken coops or patched-up truck bodies.”', '“By days when the wind bangs alley gates ajar and the sun goes by on the wind. By nights when the moon is an only child above the measured thunder of the cars, you may know Chicago’s heart at last.”', '“Yet once you’ve come to be part of this particular patch, you’ll never love another. Like loving a woman with a broken nose, you may well find lovelier lovelies. But never a lovely so real.”', '“The People of These Parts: A Survey of Modern Mid-American Letters”', '“In a future dominated by driverless cars, moral texture will erode away in favor of a rigid ethical framework.”', '“A more measured approach is to treat virtual spaces more like a bustling street—a place where, like a flâneur, you can pick up a lot of information by observing the action, while being more reticent to offer opinions and circumspect about posting.”', '“Walter Benjamin likened the flâneur to an urban investigator, within the city but detached from events, the quintessential modern artist citizen. A 2004 article in the American Historical Review explains that Benjamin saw the flâneur as a ‘sign of the alienation of the city and of capitalism.’”', '“I feel encouraged to pursue flânerie; I’m walking more, finding myself in secondhand stores or by the pier, in tea houses and dive bars—these little things do seem to matter, not least as an effective antidote to artificial busyness and its accompanying stress.”', '“The internet is among the few things humans have built that they don’t truly understand … [It] is the largest experiment involving anarchy in history. Hundreds of millions of people are, each minute, creating and consuming an untold amount of digital content in an online world that is not truly bound by terrestrial laws … This is the Internet, the world’s largest ungoverned space.”', '“Online communities like GeoCities and Tripod were the true digital arcades of that period, trading in the most obscure and the most peculiar, without any sort of hierarchy ranking them by popularity or commercial value.”', '“Several other cities are also working to reduce car use, such as Madrid, which limits access to the city center for anyone other than the people who live there. Other cities will follow.”', '“In a new zoning plan, the city is taking its intentions further, giving pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation greater priority than private cars, and planning a network of pedestrian zones that are fully car-free.”', '“Morozov mourns the death of the old Internet communities, but he misses the essential point: new arenas, new arcades have replaced them, and they’re no less valid than the old.”', '“Their march, which started from the punishing melon fields of South Texas, was his march, too. It was a deep and abiding understanding of the challenges of the farmworker’s life that drove his commitment to labor rights. The life of Cesar Chavez mirrored that of the people he was trying to help. Their cause — La Causa — was his.”', '“Chavez criss-crosses California’s Imperial and San Joaquin valleys to recruit members. At the time, he is so poor that he sometimes asks for food from the workers he is trying to help.”', '“Chavez modeled his methods on the nonviolent civil disobedience of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. — employing strikes, boycotts, marches and fasts — to draw attention to La Causa.”', '“Convoys of camouflaged soldiers with AK-47s can be seen driving to and from Caracol Morelia. On the winding roads through the mountains, army bases dot the landscape as reminders of the area’s contentious history.”', '“Many compared it to marching through a dream. After seven years under siege by 70,000 Mexican Army troops in the jungles and highlands of Chiapas, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) sent twenty-four delegates, including its pipe-smoking writer-spokesman Subcomandante Marcos, on a triumphant two-week motorcade that landed in Mexico City on March 11.”', '“The caravan came to demand constitutional recognition for Mexico’s 10 million indigenous citizens, subjected to generations of repression, poverty, racism and exploitation of their lands and labor.”', '“Since the early hours of the 21st of December 2012, thousands of Zapatistas from the Bases of Support of the EZLN — their faces covered with the legendary Zapatista pasamontañas and paliacates around their necks — started marching in silence, in perfect formation, entering the cities of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Comitan, and Altamirano, and occupying their central squares.”', '“For lack of a better term, the cars just disappeared.”', '“In the morning, we ride northeast up Hamilton Road, an old British-built highway that snakes some 110 miles from Erbil to the Iranian frontier. Near the city limits, a series of Peshmerga checkpoints give way to rolling hills dotted with farmhouses and stone fortresses dating back to the tenth century.”', '“The predicament is made worse by Kurdish motorists who seem hell-bent on running us off the road. We sputter on, past a billboard honoring the ‘immaculate precious bodies’ of all the Peshmerga martyrs who’ve fought and died to defend this terrain.”', '“At night we sometimes had to cross minefields between us. Too many men died here.”', '“Solitude in the city is about the lack of other people or rather their distance beyond a door or wall, but in remote places it isn’t an absence but the presence of something else, a kind of humming silence in which solitude seems as natural to your species as to any other, words strange rocks you may or may not turn over.”', '“The crowd is his element, as the air is that of birds and water of fishes. For the perfect flâneur, for the passionate spectator, it is an immense joy to set up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and flow of movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite. To be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home; to see the world, to be at the center of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world.”', '“Flânerie is a form of reading the street whereby human faces, displays, windows, cafe terraces, streetcars, automobiles, trees, become so many equally weighted letters which together yield the words, sentences, and pages of a book that is always new.”', '“The animal moseyed along, sniffed the ground, stopped, raised its head, and stared in our direction. I felt like it was looking right at me, up the scope and down through my bones to my toes. It didn’t appear to mind that we were ogling. The beast wended in the sagebrush, enjoying the afternoon light like a Parisian flaneur, its shape silhouetted against the snow.”', '“Dull, inert cities, it is true, do contain the seeds of their own destruction and little else. But lively, diverse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves.”', '“Perhaps to lose a sense of where you are implies the danger of losing a sense of who you are.”', '“In the warehouse just before dark, passed along the hallways and photographed the various graffiti on the walls, some of hermaphrodites and others of sharp-faced thugs smoking cigarettes; in passing through a series of rooms, saw this short fat man with a seedy mustache standing in a broken closet filled with old wet newspapers and excrement and piss, standing with his hands locked behind his head and with a hard-on poking out through his trousers from beneath a grimy heavy overcoat.”', '“Places matter. Their rules, their scale, their design include or exclude civil society, pedestrianism, equality, diversity (economic and otherwise), understanding of where water comes from and garbage goes, consumption or conservation. They map our lives.”',  '“The city does not just refer to a set of buildings in a particular place. To put it polemically, there is no such thing as a city. Rather, the city designates the space produced by the interaction of historically and geographically specific institutions, social relations of production and reproduction, practices of government, forms and media of communication and so forth. … The city, then, is above all a representation. … I would argue that the city constitutes an imagined environment.”' '“Contour walks follow edges. Contours edge. Edges are the limits, the thresholds, marking passages between things. To edge means to move gradually, carefully, or cautiously. Take a walk that contours.”', '“This vision of the walk as part of a web, rather than as a single trajectory, suits a walking philosophy that values the familiar, local, temporal and socio-cultural, as well as the unknown, immediate, solitary, wild—and indeed, finds them entangled with one another.”',  '“We know nothing about a body until we know what it can do, in other words, what its affects are, how they can or cannot enter into composition with other affects, with the affects of another body, either to destroy that body or to be destroyed by it, either to exchange actions and passions with it or to join with it in composing a more powerful body.”',  '“Mr. Arbery, 25, was a former high school football standout who was living with his mother outside the small city of Brunswick. He was shot dead in a suburban neighborhood called Satilla Shores. Friends and family said he liked to stay in good shape, and he was often seen jogging in and around his neighborhood.”', '“The site was a palimpsest, as was all the city, written, erased and rewritten. There had been communities here before Columbus ever set sail, before Verrazano anchored his ships in the narrows, or the black Portuguese slave trader Esteban Gomez sailed up the Hudson; human beings had lived here, built homes, and quarreled with their neighbors long before the Dutch ever saw a business opportunity in the rich furst and timber of the island and its calm bay. Generations rushed through the eye of the needle, and I, one of the still legible crowd, entered the subway. I wanted to find the line that connected me to my own part in these stories.”', '“Flanerie as a form of perception is preserved in the characteristic fungibility of people and things in mass society, and in the merely imaginary gratification provided by advertising, illustrated journals, fashion and sex magazines, all of which go by the flaneur’s principle of look, but don’t touch.”', '“Patchwriting is a form of imitation, of mimesis. It is a process of evaluating a source text, selecting passages pertinent to the patchwriter’s purposes, and transporting those passages to the patchwriter’s new context. Patchwriting accomplishes a (re)formation of a source text by providing a new locale and thus new meaning for source material. It is a form of verbal sculpture, molding new shapes from preexisting materials. It is a form of pentimento, in which one writer reshapes the work of another while leaving traces of the earlier writer’s thought and intentions.”', '“But the world he inhabited was changing. While he sought solitude, he kept bumping into development. Land he had passed through was no longer public, and was vanishing behind fences. Everywhere he looked, he saw ever more roads and cars.”', '“The two disciplines are no longer held discrete. They coexist within a blurred genre or a science/fiction, a mixture of narration and scientific practices, an integrated approach to recording, writing and illustrating the material past.”',  '“The intention to walk creates a series of situations; an unrolling of rhythmic experience which resembles a music partiture: moments of different intensities, rhythms and pauses. To walk is to produce a line of experience; an assemblage of gathered interactions between self and the world. While walking we connect past, present and future.”', '“So: start in the middle and read outward, start in the middle and read upward; it is yours to make: design, whittle, cut, snip, tie, glue, trim, rasp, paint, grow vexed, cuss, and pitch it across the room (we will then share one more thing): it is yours to show how the pieces can fit together, perhaps even to demonstrate how the job should be done.”', '“The Europeans who became Americans conquered and developed in their own image a territory of whose very existence their forebears had been ignorant. In that way they were quintessential aliens—yet they described their national origin and growth as an impulse of the land itself. And, as the land’s basic dimension is not time but space, the United States were defined primarily as a place.”', '“Driving around the city, it didn’t take long to realize that if you didn’t have a vehicle, a machine of speed, you owned poverty. It was yet another city dying of a disease whose anatomy was just beyond the inhabitants’ grasp. Its origins may have been as a trading post in another time but now it had become a government war town filled with a half million workers employed in the various research centers attempting to perfect a president’s dream of laser warfare from the floating veil of outerspace. Local papers were filled with patriotic hard-ons in the face of recent successes in the nearby desert where researchers were able to knock a dummy missile out of the clear blue sky with a laser discharged from a device the size of a refrigerator. Other than the clouds in the sky, an occasional bird or dog and the anonymous nomadic poor, all movement in the city was confined to the automobile.”', '“A process of displacement and what I call ‘accumulation by dispossession’ lie at the core of urbanization under capitalism. It is the mirror-image of capital absorption through urban redevelopment, and is giving rise to numerous conflicts over the capture of valuable land from low-income populations that may have lived there for many years.”', '“Walking-writing is a practice of muddling things, of making problems, and agitating thought. In the speculative middle, one does not resolve or clarify an idea, rather walking-writing complicates, stirs, and unsettles thought. In fact, sometimes nothing comes out of a speculative middle. Sometimes it’s about failure and a letting go.”', '“For the future to be open, space must be open too.”', '“Aboveground I was with thousands of others in their solitude, but in the subway, standing close to strangers, jostling them and being jostled by them  and breathing room, all of us reenacting unacknowledged traumas, the solitude intensified.”', '“Culture was reconceived as an assemblage of disparate and incommensurate things throwing themselves together in scenes, acts, encounters, performances, and situations. Writing became an attunement, a response, a vigilant protection of a worlding. Both writing and culture became potentially generative and capacious. A writing might skid over the surface of something throwing itself together or it might pause on a strand as it moved with other strands or fell out of sync, becoming an anomaly or a problem. Writing could be a way of thinking.”']
